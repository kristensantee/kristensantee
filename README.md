# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Full Stack & Ready to Act
I have worked professionally across a diverse array of fields and I bring a unique and thoughtful perspective to every role. From training as an archaeologist at an ancient Etruscan site to member-facing roles at a large credit union, I have understood the importance of sound data and solid analytics. I love to learn and share in knowledge and I love to be part of a winning team.

ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are she/her/hers

ðŸ§  I am currently developing Project Management skills
